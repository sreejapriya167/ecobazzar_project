# EcoBazzar

EcoBazzar is a full-stack web application built using **Spring Boot** for the backend and **Angular** for the frontend.  
The backend handles APIs, authentication, and database operations, while the frontend provides a responsive user interface.  

The project is divided into two parts:  
- **backend/** → Contains the Spring Boot application  
- **frontend/** → Contains the Angular application  

Both work together to create a complete e-commerce platform setup.
